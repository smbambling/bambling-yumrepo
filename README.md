## Module Description

Installs YUM repositories and their corosponding RPM GPG Key(s).

Additionally runs the following commands to make the repositories usable "quicker"
 - yum clean all
 - yum makecache

## Helpful Hint

To avoid order of operations issues where the required repository is not installed before
the needed package I recommend adding the following to your manifest.  This will set the correct
order of operations between Yumrepo resources and Package resources

````
Yumrepo <| |> -> Package <| |>
````
